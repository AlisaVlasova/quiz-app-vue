# Test Task for Frontend Vue Developer

## Introduction

This test task is designed to assess your skills and experience as a Vue.js developer. You will be required to create a simple Quiz web application that demonstrates your ability to work with Vue.js.

## Requirements

We need you to develop a web application with the following features:

- A home page that displays a list of quizzes retrieved from an API endpoint or JSON data. The list should be displayed in a visually appealing format, with each quiz item containing an image and a brief description of the quiz's topic.
- Allow users to search for quizzes by name.
- Each quiz item should be clickable, taking the user to the quiz page. The quiz page should have a clean and intuitive interface, with a progress bar showing the user how far along they are in the quiz.
- On the quiz page, each question should be displayed one at a time, with the question title and a set of checkboxes for answer options. The checkboxes should be designed to be easy to use and visually appealing.
- After completing the quiz, the user should be shown their results, with a breakdown of how many questions they answered correctly and incorrectly.

## Guidelines

- Use Vue.js to build the web application.
- Use Git for version control.
- Deploy the web application to gh-pages.
- Write clean and well-organized code.
- Write a README.md file explaining how to run the application and any other relevant information.

## Submission

When you have completed the task, please submit a link to the GitHub repository containing your code and the URL to the deployed application.

Good luck!
